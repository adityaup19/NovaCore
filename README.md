# NovaCore: Closed-Loop Life-Support Simulator

A **mini-MVP simulator** for orbital habitat life-support systems.  
Models **CO₂ scrubbing, O₂ regeneration, temperature, and humidity control** in a closed-loop environment.  
Built in **Python + Streamlit** for interactivity, visualization, and telemetry export.

## 🚀 Features
- **CO₂ Production & Scrubbing** — simulate astronaut metabolic CO₂ production and scrubbing efficiency.  
- **O₂ Regeneration** — configurable O₂ yield from scrubbed CO₂ (plants, algae, electrolysis).  
- **Temperature Regulation** — balance heat gain vs. radiator cooling.  
- **Humidity Control** — model humidity from respiration vs. condenser removal.  
- **Interactive Web UI** — adjust sliders in real time, see plots update instantly.  
- **CSV Telemetry Export** — download simulation results for further analysis.  
- **Log Scale Option** — toggle logarithmic scale to reveal tiny CO₂ dynamics alongside O₂ growth.
