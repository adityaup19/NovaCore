# NovaCore: Closed-Loop Life-Support Simulator 

# Live Demo
Try it here: [NovaCore Simulator](https://novacore-ktgnnohb9bpknoy6zanss7.streamlit.app/)


A **mini-MVP simulator** for orbital habitat life-support systems.  
Models **CO‚ÇÇ scrubbing, O‚ÇÇ regeneration, temperature, and humidity control** in a closed-loop environment.  
Built in **Python + Streamlit** for interactivity, visualization, and telemetry export.

## üöÄ Features
- **CO‚ÇÇ Production & Scrubbing** - simulate astronaut metabolic CO‚ÇÇ production and scrubbing efficiency.  
- **O‚ÇÇ Regeneration** - configurable O‚ÇÇ yield from scrubbed CO‚ÇÇ (plants, algae, electrolysis).  
- **Temperature Regulation** - balance heat gain vs. radiator cooling.  
- **Humidity Control** - model humidity from respiration vs. condenser removal.  
- **Interactive Web UI** - adjust sliders in real time, see plots update instantly.  
- **CSV Telemetry Export** - download simulation results for further analysis.  
- **Log Scale Option** - toggle logarithmic scale to reveal tiny CO‚ÇÇ dynamics alongside O‚ÇÇ growth.
